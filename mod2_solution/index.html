        Take all summer,<br>
        your ember<br><br>
    
        from the sun,<br>
        its walking meditation.<br><br>
    
        Store it in small<br>
        vaults of light<br><br>
    
        to keep<br>
        the rest of us<br><br>
    
        when winter seals<br>
        around each day.<br><br>
    
        We'll flicker<br>
        to the table.<br><br>
    
        We'll gather<br>
        to your orange flame.</p>

        <p class="title">Blame It On Summer</p>
        <p id="p2"><br><br>By Linda Rodriguez<br><br>
        that I smile too widely,<br>
        grinning really, and laugh<br>
        too loud and often; that I walk<br>
        with spring and sensual sway;<br>
        that I stretch myself and twist<br>
        like a cat<br>
        baking in the backyard<br>
        brightness; that my brain is sun-bleached,<br>
        all rule and thought boiled away, leaving<br>
        only sensory steam;<br>
        that my feverish eyes see strange dancing<br>
        flames in afternoon shadows<br>
        along the sides of streets and Bedouin oases, fragrant<br>
        with dates and goats and acrid desert waters,<br>
        in every suburban garden we pass<br>
        while you argue and drive<br>
        and I stare, heavy-brained with heat<br>
        and too aware of my own body<br>
        and every other;<br>
        that I take a lover,<br>
        brazenly, crazily,<br>
        too sun-stupid to be careful,<br>
        in my dreams.</p>

        <p class="title">The Sound I Listened For</p>
        <p id="p3"><br><br>By Robert Francis<br><br>
            What I remember is the ebb and flow of sound<br>
            &nbsp;That summer morning as the mower came and went<br>
            &nbsp;And came again, crescendo and diminuendo,<br>
            &nbsp;And always when the sound was loudest how it ceased<br>
            &nbsp;A moment while he backed the horses for the turn,<br>
            &nbsp;The rapid clatter giving place to the slow click<br>
            &nbsp;And the mower's voice. That was the sound I listened for,<br>
            &nbsp;The voice did what the horses did. It shared the action<br>
            &nbsp;As sympathetic magic does or incantation.<br>
            &nbsp;The voice hauled and the horses hauled. The strength of one<br>
            &nbsp;Was in the other and in the strength was impatience.<br>
            &nbsp;Over and over as the mower made his rounds<br>
            &nbsp;I heard his voice and only once or twice he backed<br>
            &nbsp;And turned and went ahead and spoke no word at all.</p>
